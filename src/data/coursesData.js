<strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> HS101. A good hold over the topics in HS101 is extremely helpful and understanding of graphs and mathematical portion of HS101 helps a lot if remembered. Concepts like Theories of demand, supply and market equilibrium, theories of firm, production and costs, perfect and imperfect competition, oligopoly, monopoly do continue in greater detail from HS101.

<strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Will be updated soon

<strong>Review of the course in terms of learning experience and teaching style:</strong>
Overall the course is wide and covers various topics and can become interesting if studied well ðŸ™‚. Subrato sir keeps the class interactive and always takes doubt without insulting your intelligence, heâ€™ll always get back to you and clear all your doubts even if they had already been taught in previous courses. He also keeps the class amusing by asking various challenging riddles which might help in your Quant profile Tests, and have a taste of Game Theory. He is really practical in things and would love to have a cup of tea with you.

<strong>Overview of the content covered, materials used and time commitment required:</strong>
Theory of Consumer Behaviour: Preferences, Indifference curves, utility, choice, substitution and income effects, demand curves.
Theory of Firm: Production function, returns to scale, cost function, profit function, short and long run supply curve.
Game Theory & Strategic Behaviour: Classification, Nash Equilibrium, Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, Mixed Strategy Equilibrium, Simultaneous & Sequential move games.
Market Structure: Price and output decisions under different market structures like: Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Duopoly, Oligopoly, and Monopolistic Competition. Mergers, Cournot Model, Stackelberg Model, & Bertrand Model, & Collusive Oligopoly.

Hal R Varian is used as reference during the complete course and has almost all the topics covered.

Understanding of concepts do take time and are quite vast, though regular practice helps a lot especially using the problem sets provided by Subrato sir during the course.

<strong>Review of the evaluation methods and grading:</strong>
There are 3 group assignments, a midsem and an endsem. The exams are open book and open notes. The grading can become bad if the st. deviation in marks of the class is quite high.

<strong>Suggestions for those taking this course:</strong>
It can get difficult understanding the concepts in class since sometimes it can feel that few topics need revision or topics being taught are more scattered. Reading the topics through Hal R Varian and taking the learning in a practical sense like practicing more numericals can help better understand the topics in a better way. Moreover, do solve the problem sets given by Subrato sir, they cover most of the curriculum and have a similar format as the exam and sometimes you may get the same question in the exam ðŸ˜‰. The Group Assignments also help a lot in remaining consistent with the topics being taught in class.

<strong>Level of Difficulty:</strong> 3/5

<strong>Grading:</strong> Relatively good, professor does distribute lot of grades in AA AB BB tranches

<strong>Time Commitment required:</strong> 2-3 hrs

<strong>Attendance Policy:</strong> Quite strict, professor expects a 100% attendance, keeps track of all students and gives marks if attendance is good enough.

<strong>Course Evaluation Scheme:</strong>
Depends on the professor, but generally:
10-15% Quiz
30-35% Midsem
35-40% Endsem
10-15% course project

<strong>Course Review:</strong>
Highly recommended if you wish to gain valuable insight into macroeconomics. Professor is strict and expects discipline from his students. If one attends class regularly and develops a grip on the subject then it will be very useful for him/her, not just to get a decent grade but in the future subjects as well. Doesnâ€™t require too much effort but moderate amount of time and effort will be enough.

<strong>Reference used and Relevance:</strong>
Professor uses his own slides as well as reference to many articles and books while teaching. Provides physical handouts of the same to the students for the same. However best source of information would be class notes as he expects you to note down everything as majority of the information is disseminated through the blackboard/verbally.

<strong>Course Content:</strong> Course content is quite interesting, starts off with the introduction of correlation between macroeconomics and politics, then trickles down into the evolution of multiple consumption theories of macroeconomics. It gives an insight into macroeconomic issues such as inflation and unemployment, and takes us on a journey on how macroeconomic theory evolved to tackle these issues post the Great Depression in 1929. The course has a mix of theory and technical aspects such as national income accounting and output multipliers which help in the better understanding of the subject. Finally the course concludes on a high note with an introduction to money and banking such as supply & demand of money.

<strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> None

<strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> The course develops a good understanding of the mathematical concepts which are going to be used in various economic models. Optimisation Methods come in use later on in Utility maximisation problems and other microeconomic Models, and helps in understanding the necessary assumptions. The various concepts & models also help in understanding macroeconomic concepts like IS LM model which comes in greater depth in Macro II and Models like cobweb model.

<strong>Review of the course in terms of learning experience and teaching style:</strong>
The course is quite simple in the beginning, jee stuff, but also contains their applications in economics which can be new and practical examples, which can feel calculation intensive, and the professor pre-midsem also asks for proper language for the problems, which can get difficult, remembering all the assumptions in each case. Yes, the different economic applications contain their own assumptions which are to be remembered and mentioning them is quite important from the perspective of exams.
The prof gives notes orally in the class and explains things on the board.
The subject is mathematically intensive and post midsem part has a lot of optimization situations, and various economic models which come in use at different different courses, like Macroeconomics and microeconomics.

<strong>Overview of the content covered, materials used and time commitment required:</strong>
Linear Models & Matrix Algebra: Cramerâ€™s Rule, Input Output Matrices (Leontif) â€“ IS-LM Analysis, Input Space, Investment Model
Partial & General Market Equilibrium
Equilibrium in National Income Analysis
Optimization: Quasi-concavity and quasi-convexity, Karusch-Kuhn-Tucker necessary and sufficient conditions
Comparative Static Analysis: Envelope theorem, Implicit function theorem
Homogenous & Nomothetic functions.

The materials used as reference were: A. Chiang which covers everything from very basic, Simon Blume â€“ which is a really good book in terms of understanding various economic applications. Though post midsem â€“ optimisation was mainly covered from Chiang. Aditi mam mostly uses her own notes.

The course is quite heavy and needs good understanding of topics, and calculus.

<strong>Review of the evaluation methods and grading:</strong>
Pre midsem: A quiz and midsem
Post midsem: Endsem
Attendance is strict and DX grade is awarded in case of less than 80% attendance

<strong>Suggestions for those taking this course:</strong>
Pay attention on the assumptions taken in various models, and practice calculus as it is needed in the post midsem part extensively. The course needs a good effort in terms of both practice and memorising and will help in mathematical analysis in the courses ahead.

<strong>Course Feedback:</strong>
The course has very interesting content; however, because the content is vast, the pace of the course is quite fast. Most of the theory covered in this course overlapped with Statistics 1 and 2, so learning this course does make those courses a bit easier to grasp. Apart from the theoretical content, the course also consisted of Python tutorials once a week. I would advise you to learn the basics of Python and go through the tutorial problems before the lab, especially if you are new to Python.

Attending lectures will not be enough and it is advised to go through the material on your own. Exams were of medium to hard difficulty, and questions based on Python were also asked in the papers.

The course content is very relevant, so I would recommend understanding it beyond just wanting to do well in the exams.

<strong>Course Feedback:</strong>
Almost everything taught in this course was covered in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course that we had. Index Numbers and Price Index is the only new topic, which is relatively simple. The course content is quite light.
Classes mostly consist of the concept being taught and related questions being solved.
The reference book used is "Introduction To Probability And Statistics for Engineers And Scientists." Do go through the book and solve the exercises and solved examples as questions in the quizzes, midsem or endsem could come from there. A decent understanding of the book and practice should help you do well in the exams, as most questions are straightforward.
Do try to understand the concepts, as statistics is quite an important subject.

<strong>Course Content:</strong>
Introduction to Statistics for Economics  
Descriptive Statistics: Frequency distributions, Measures of central tendency, Measures of dispersion, Skewness, Kurtosis, Quantiles, Measuring changes in price and quantity: theory of index numbers.

<strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> The course has no such pre requisite and lays the foundation for courses like stats 2 and econometrics

<strong>Review of the course in terms of learning experience and teaching style:</strong> The concepts learned have a good structure and are essential for better understanding of topics ahead. Mam teaches almost everything with Sheldon Ross as reference, explaining the topics on board, while no slides are provided (anyways not required too). Classes are open to discussion and doubts. Since, this course is an introduction to all the necessary concepts required for courses ahead, things are simple and can be grasped with practice of numericals.

<strong>Overview of the content covered, materials used and time commitment required:</strong>
Introduction to Statistics for Economics Descriptive Statistics: Frequency distributions, Measures of central tendency, Measures of dispersion, Skewness, Kurtosis, Quantiles.
Probability, Random Variables and Moments: Sample space, Events, Probability, Bayesâ€™ Theorem, Random variable, Expectation, Variance, Moments and moment generating function Discrete Probability Distributions: Bernoulli distribution, Binomial distribution, Poisson Distribution. Continuous Probability Distributions: Uniform distribution, Normal distribution. Joint Probability Distributions: Jointly distributed random variables: discrete and continuous case, Independent random variables, Marginal and conditional distributions covariance
Introduction to time series, seasonal effects, cyclical effects and irregular effects

Sheldon Ross is followed throughout the course and is a very good book for both, understanding concepts and practicing problems.

Time commitment isnâ€™t that much. Paying attention in class and solving problems with the professor during the lecture, and revising well before exams is sufficient enough for performing good.

<strong>Review of the evaluation methods and grading: </strong>
Midsem + Endsem (45 marks each) + Attendance â€“ 10 marks

The exams focuses on problem solving and checking is good focusing on important points like proper application of concept and correct answer and not lengthy subjective answers are required (by Neha mam). Since, the exam does not demand lengthy answers, the time can be managed efficiently in exams, though there can be a few questions which may take time even with calculators.
Attendance carries marks only for the sake of motivating students to attend classes.

Grading is good for the course and the prof understands the studentâ€™s needs if the class responds well to the class interactions

<strong>Suggestions for those taking this course:</strong>
Read the reference books and try solving the numericals on your own, without theory reading you cannot build over concepts. Being consistent with problem solving with the prof in class would surely help in getting great marks in exams. Also, get fast with using calculators and using stats functions and storing data, will help in stats II also.

<strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> The course continues from Intermediate Micro I with advanced topics in Microeconomics.

<strong>Review of the course in terms of learning experience and teaching style:</strong>
The first half of the course was taken by Prof Neha Gupta. She was largely chill and classes were mostly interesting.
The second half was taken by Prof Ghosh. The course contents were interesting and he went at a pretty chill pace so there were no issues if you attended classes.

<strong>Overview of the content covered, materials used and time commitment required:</strong>
In the first half, a few topics from Hal Varian were covered, at a very easy and straightforward level
On studentsâ€™ request, slides were also provided.

The second half saw a few topic covered from the Games of Strategy book. It wasnâ€™t exactly a perfect continuation from the first half but it was pretty interesting. The notations and the content was a bit weird in the beginning but easy enough if youâ€™re paying attention.

<strong>Evaluation Methods:</strong>
Quiz: 10%  
Midsem: 40%  
Attendance (2nd half): 5%  
Endsem: 45%

For the first half, quiz and midsem were straightforward and easy. In exams, marking was done very leniently.
In the second half, >80% attendance gave you 5 marks in the total score.
The endsem was pretty easy. Everything was directly from the class notes.

<strong>Suggestions:</strong>Itâ€™s a pretty easy course, so do put decent enough efforts.

<strong>Level of Difficulty:</strong> 2.5/5 (average/slightly difficult)

<strong>Grading:</strong> 3.5/5 (can be detrimental for CPI)

<strong>Time Commitment Required:</strong> 2/5 (Not too much time commitment required)

<strong>Brief Description:</strong> Course content is very interesting, whether it is welfare economics, externalities, or Game theory, all the topics are good and useful for forming a holistic view of market activities. This course only involves midsem, endsem and quizzes. No tuts/assignments or projects in the course.

<strong>Prof Review:</strong> The instructors are nice, they teach the concepts well and one can ask as many doubts as they want to. Prof Neha Gupta also gives proper notes while prof Ghosh keep class more of a discussion type. Classes are organized as per time-table, twice a week(1.5 hours each). Generally no extra classes are taken. The exams conducted by the Profs are also of suitable difficulty.

Teaching is through Presentation of Slides, Writing on Board, Class discussion of readings provided and Numerical solving and discussion in class. Attendance is through Oral Name Call and Marked by Instructor. Some marks weightage may be given to the attendance.

<strong>Course Content:</strong>
Choice under Risk and Uncertainty: Preferences, Time Value of preferences, Net Present Value General Equilibrium, Efficiency and Welfare: Multi market equilibrium; partial and general equilibrium compared; Equilibrium and efficiency under pure exchange and production; Topics in Multimarket Equilibrium; Existence, uniqueness and stability of equilibrium. Welfare Economics: Pareto Optimality; the efficiency of Perfect Competition; efficiency of imperfect competition; external effects in consumption and production; inter-dependent utility function; taxation and subsidies; Social welfare function; the theory of second best. Market Failure: Externalities; public goods and markets with asymmetric information.

<strong>Exam Pattern:</strong>
Midsem + Endsem â€“ 35-40% each  
Quizzes â€“ 10-15% (2 quizzes)

<strong>Advice:</strong>
This course can prove useful for future courses like Public finance and international economics and is also helpful for getting research interns/projects in economics. It is important to be comfortable with some of the concepts taught in HS221 ( micro 1) for better understanding of this course.

Course content is not too difficult to understand, take notes in the class and do read Hal Varian for better understanding. It is suggested to practice good amount of numericals to score good in Neha Maâ€™amâ€™s exam. Difficulty level of the exam is moderate. Go through notes by Prof Neha thoroughly, and try to grab a real understanding of what is happening instead of cramming the processes to solve questions. Take part in class discussion through questions, critical comments, etc.

<strong>Recommended Book:</strong> Hal Varian

<strong>Level of Difficulty:</strong> 4/5

<strong>Grading:</strong> It was decent, good amount of AA-AB-BB but also FRs were high in number

<strong>Time Commitment required:</strong> 3-4 hours

<strong>Attendance Policy:</strong> Professor is strict about students attending the classes regularly and takes attendance. Professor may or may not give marks for attendance, but no DX (however in extreme cases he has the discretion to award DX)

<strong>Course Evaluation Scheme:</strong> One quiz, midsem, group project (research), endsem

<strong>Course Review:</strong>
This course paints a larger picture of macroeconomics, so it can be considered a step-up, harder version than intermediate macro-1 course. There is a lot to take in and some things might not make sense at first, given that you will have to cope up with the Classical assumptions which are in contrast to the Keynesian framework. Have to regularly attend classes and much more reliance on personal notes and understanding. Professor will be more strict, technical and straightforward than the previous macro-1 course and political discussions will be much less in number. Evaluation scheme will be similar to one faced in the previous course.

<strong>Reference used and Relevance:</strong>
Slides are provided for a certain, but not all content. Many handouts and papers are uploaded to study the topic in depth, professor expects you to go through all resources very thoroughly. Handwritten notes are the best source of information, so do attend all the classes without fail.

<strong>Course Content:</strong>
The course was interesting for students who have an interest in Macroeconomics and public policy. Highlights the journey of macroeconomics since the times of mercantalist trade till the 20th century. The focus of this course would be to understand the classical theory, in contrast to the Keynesian theory of Intermediate macro-I . Here, a few elaborate models are also derived using these classical theoretical assumptions.

<strong>Level of Difficulty:</strong> 3/5

<strong>Grading:</strong> 4/5

<strong>Time commitment required:</strong> 3/5

<strong>Brief description of the course:</strong>
Course content is critical thinking and reasoning based. The content is based on real incidents which have occurred in the past and reasoning deduced from them to structure macroeconomic concepts in more detail. Class is organized 3 times a week (1 hour each).

<strong>Prof Review:</strong>
Course appears to be quite boring due to the teaching style. There is mostly one-way sort of lecturing. The experience may not be so good, mainly because instructions are not good enough.

<strong>Teaching:</strong>
Teaching is through presentation of slides and discussion of readings. Attendance policy states Minimum percentage requirement otherwise DX (though this may be relaxed afterwards). Attendance is taken through roll sheet passed by TA/instructor.

<strong>Course content:</strong>
Derivation of Aggregate Supply and Interlinkage Between Aggregate Supply and Phillips Curve  
Unemployment and Theories of Inflation  
Interest Rate Targeting vis-a-vis Money Supply Targeting  
Real Business Cycle Theory: Impact of Technology shock, Fiscal shock  
New Keynesian Macroeconomics: Staggering of Wage and Price, Overlapping Wage Contract.

Overall, the course content is not that difficult and is not too time consuming.

<strong>Exam pattern:</strong>
Assignment/quiz â€“ 15, midsem â€“ 35 (scaled)

Examination may not be as expected. No critical thinking or application based questions are asked. The evaluation is on the lenient side.

<strong>Advice for the course:</strong>
It is advisable to brush upon the important concepts of HS223 (Macro 1) because this course builds upon those topics. Extensive reading (mindful reading) by your own is very necessary. Refer good books like Richard T. Froyen or Robert J. Gordon to grab concepts easily and try to discuss this with your friends.

The Course content is quite interesting. In our case, there was a major overlap between this course and the AI DS course in the third semester. However, there was a greater emphasis in understanding the theory behind it in this course. The course is important because it lays the foundation for courses such as econometrics 1 and 2 and is also useful for the future.

Slides are not used in class. Mostly material from the books is taught. The instructor made an effort to include economic examples so as to understand the application of the statistical concepts in the field.

The exams tend to be moderately difficult, with a mix of questions that require proving and solving. Be careful with notations and focus on concepts to do well.

<strong>Time commitment required:</strong> 4/5 (study at regular intervals)

<strong>Brief description of the course:</strong>
The course demands interest in mathematics and statistics. Course content is good. Exams can be moderately difficult but that won't be a problem if you are regular. It is important to brush up on some of the key concepts of stats 1 because this course is a continuation of the same.

stats 2 -> Econometrics 1 -> Econometrics 2 is the order of progression. This course will be the prerequisite for almost all the courses that are based on statistics or involve mathematical analysis.

<strong>Prof Review:</strong>
The instructors try their best to make the classes more engaging and do clear all the doubts if you ask. Classes are well organized and can be extended by 10-30 mins if short on time. Their teaching is also excellent.

<strong>Advice for the course:</strong>
DO NOT SKIP this course just because you feel that your instructor is not good or you donâ€™t like the course. Just 2 hours of self-study per week will also suffice. Donâ€™t study it for grades since itâ€™ll be helpful in many ways in the future. There are also a few tutorials which are helpful (ungraded).

This course also proves useful for future courses, getting research projects/ interns in economics and is also helpful for placements. References to follow are First Course in Probability by Sheldon Ross, Statistics for Engineers and Scientists.

<strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> This course covered further important topics in Statistics in preparation for Econometrics starting in the next sem. The topics covered are also very important from the point of view of Internship preparation.

<strong>Review of the course in terms of learning experience and teaching style:</strong>
The first half was a bit difficult to follow and some things felt needlessly complicated.  
The second half went a bit smoother as most of the things were directly from Ross and were relatively easier to follow.

<strong>Overview of the content covered, materials used and time commitment required:</strong>
Pre midsem, topics were from Ross but inputs from other books were taken, really complicating things and focusing on the proofs.  
Sheldon Ross was followed very closely after the midsem.

<strong>Review of the evaluation methods and grading:</strong>
15%: Quiz I  
35%: Midsem  
15%: Quiz II  
35%: Endsem  

The midsem was comparatively very tough.  
Checking was also quite tough, with marks deducted for the smallest things.  
Grading was decent at top but not that good going down, but it was reasonable considering how badly most people did.

<strong>Suggestions for those taking this course:</strong>
This course requires more commitments than the others so do put a decent amount of effort.
